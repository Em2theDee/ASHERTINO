# ASHERTINO
Ashertino is a custom-designed keyboard built specifically for designers. The project focuses on improving ergonomics, layout efficiency, and open source flexibility. It features an ortholinear layout, custom "action keys" to replace outdated function keys, and unique letterform keycaps. The layout itself is based on Colemak, chosen for its efficiency and comfort over traditional QWERTY layouts.

The keyboard layout and key placements were created using VIA for remapping and testing. The physical prototype was developed using Rhino for precise modelling and Blender for rendering and animation. Keycaps were 3D printed using PLA, with several rounds of testing and adjustments for fit and switch stability. The project also makes use of the Lucide open source icon set and incorporates open source design principles throughout. Hardware prototyping was supported by Ravensbourne's technical staff, using CNC machining, UV printing, and manual modifications.

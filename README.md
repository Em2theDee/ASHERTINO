# ASHERTINO
Ashertino is a custom-designed keyboard built specifically for designers. It focuses on improving ergonomics, efficiency, and workflow flexibility. The project combines a custom ortholinear layout, unique letterform keycaps, and open source principles. Ashertino challenges default keyboard layouts and explores how physical design and user experience can better serve creative work.

Features
Ortholinear layout for better ergonomics and flexible key arrangement

Custom "action keys" to replace outdated function keys

Custom keycap designs shaped like letterforms

Designed with open source components and tools

3D model and prototype tested

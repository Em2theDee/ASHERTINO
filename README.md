# ASHERTINO
Ashertino is a custom-designed keyboard built specifically for designers. It focuses on improving ergonomics, efficiency, and workflow flexibility. The project combines a custom ortholinear layout, unique letterform keycaps, and open source principles. Ashertino challenges default keyboard layouts and explores how physical design and user experience can better serve creative work.

The keyboard layout and key placements were created using VIA for remapping and testing, with QMK explored for deeper customisation. The physical prototype was developed using Rhino for precise modelling and Blender for rendering and animation. Keycaps were 3D printed using PLA, with several rounds of testing and adjustments for fit and switch stability. The project also makes use of the Lucide open source icon set and incorporates open source design principles throughout. Hardware prototyping was supported by Ravensbourne's technical staff, using CNC machining, UV printing, and manual modifications.

# ASHERTINO
Ashertino is a custom-designed keyboard built specifically for designers. It focuses on improving ergonomics, efficiency, and workflow flexibility. The project combines a custom ortholinear layout, unique letterform keycaps, and open source principles. Ashertino challenges default keyboard layouts and explores how physical design and user experience can better serve creative work.

Features
